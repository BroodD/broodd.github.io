                            Trading in the cryptocurrency market carries inherent risks, just like any investment
                            avenue. While engaging in this market, understand that there are no guarantees of profit.
                            Market fluctuations could impact your portfolio positively or negatively at any given time.

                            face losses during their trading journey.
