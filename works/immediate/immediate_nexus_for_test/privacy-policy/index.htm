            </p>
            <p>
                We may be required, due to legal or other obligations outside Our
                control, to transfer Personal Data about you to third parties,
                such as public authorities. In such circumstances, We have limited

                The right to obtain a copy of the Personal Data shall not
                adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others. Therefore, if

                may not fulfill your request or do so in a limited manner.
            </p>
            <p><b>Right to rectification</b></p>
            <p>
                You have the right to obtain from the Company the rectification of
                inaccurate Personal Data about you. Taking into account the
                purposes of the processing, you have the right for incomplete
                Personal Data about you to be completed, including by means of
                providing a supplementary statement.
            </p>
            <p><b>Right to erasure</b></p>
            <p>
                the following grounds applies: (a) the Personal Data is no longer
                necessary in relation to the purpose for which it was collected or
                otherwise processed; (b) you withdraw your consent on which the
                processing is based and there is no other legal ground for the

                your particular situation, to the processing of Personal Data
                about you that is based on the legitimate interests pursued by Us
                or by a third party, and there are no overriding legitimate
                grounds for the processing; (d) you object to the processing of

                Company is subject.
            </p>
            <p>
                This right is not applicable to the extent that the processing is
                necessary (a) for compliance with a legal obligation that requires
                processing by European Union or Member State law to which the
                Company is subject; or (b) for the establishment, exercise, or

            <p><b>Right of restriction of processing</b></p>

                You have the right to obtain from the Company the restriction of
                processing of Personal Data about you if one of the following
                applies: (a) the accuracy of the Personal Data is contested by
                you, for a period enabling the Company to verify the accuracy of
                the Personal Data about you; (b) the processing is unlawful and
                you oppose the erasure of the Personal Data about you and request
                the restriction of its use instead; (c) the Company no longer
                needs the Personal Data about you for the purposes of processing,
                but the Personal Data is required by you for the establishment,
                exercise, or defense of legal claims; (d) if the processing of
                Personal Data about you is necessary for the purpose of the
                legitimate interests pursued by the Company or by a third party,
                unless We demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the
                processing that override your interests, rights, and freedoms or
                for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims; or
                (e) if the Personal Data about you is processed for direct
                marketing purposes, including profiling, to the extent it is
                related to such direct marketing.
            </p>
            <p>
                If the processing of Personal Data about you has been restricted
                following your request, such Personal Data shall, with the
                exception of storage, only be processed with your consent or for
                the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the
                protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for
                reasons of important public interest of the European Union or of a
                Member State.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Right to Data Portability</strong></p>
            <p>
                You possess the right to obtain your Personal Data, which you've supplied to the Company, in a
                structured, widely used, and machine-readable format. You also have the right to transfer that data to
                another entity if the processing is grounded on your consent or a contract you're part of, and if the
                processing is automated.
            </p>
            <p>
                When utilizing your data portability right, you can have your Personal Data sent directly from the
                Company to another entity, where it's technically possible. This right does not affect your and the
                Company's rights regarding data deletion. Moreover, exercising this right must not negatively impact the
                rights and freedoms of others.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Right to Withdraw Consent</strong></p>
            <p>
                At any moment, you can revoke your consent that allows us to process your Personal Data, which will not
                impact the legality of any processing conducted prior to your withdrawal.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Right to Object</strong></p>
            <p>
                You have the right to challenge the processing of your Personal Data at any time, particularly if it
                relates to your specific circumstances, and when the processing is justified by the legitimate interests
                of the Company or a third party. This includes any profiling based on these interests. Upon objection,
                we will stop processing your Personal Data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for
                the processing that outweigh your interests, rights, and freedoms, or for the establishment, exercise,
                or defense of legal claims.
            </p>
            <p>
                You also have the right to oppose the processing of your Personal Data for direct marketing purposes at
                any time, including any related profiling.

                rights and freedoms of natural persons in relation to the
                processing of Personal Data within the European Union.

                otherwise in this section 13. Where requests are manifestly
                unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive
                character, We may either (a) charge a reasonable fee, taking into
                account the administrative costs of providing the information or
                communication or taking the action requested; or (b) refuse to act
                on the request.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Company may require you to provide additional information
                necessary to confirm your identity in order to fulfill your
                request according to your rights outlined in this section 13, if
